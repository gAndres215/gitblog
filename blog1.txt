Today I refreshed on a few git topics.  I have created this repo through the command line which reminded me of the process of using git init, setting my git configs, and finally attaching my repo to my github.  Git is an extradorniary tool which as a beginner, the first three commands I needed to understand were 1)git status which notfies me of where my files are in the staging area 2) git add which prepares the files for inclusion to the repo and 3) git commit which creates makes the new commited version of my repo the tip of my point of reference. I did this a few times by cloning this and other repos on various machines. After those three commands I needed one to update or "push" my lates version to my repo hosted on github.  And to do this I used, you got it, the git push command.  After authorizing my credentials it pushed my current working repo to the github repo where it is hosted. I hope to learn more about branching and merging for my next post so lets see where that gets me.
