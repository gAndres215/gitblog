This is a repository that I will use as a personal blog of what I have learned.  As a just incase someone stumbles across this I will state a few things about myself.  I am a junior in college going for a BS in Computer Science.  I am also pursuing a full stack tech degree from treehous(see other repositories for progress on that. I hope to catalog my journey from student to professional and even if this blog never sees the light of day I hope I can look back at it and appreciate the journey. 

Here goes nothing.
